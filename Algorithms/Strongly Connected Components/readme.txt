Note: The code was scripted and run in Spyder.

1. Make sure the input files are in a folder called ‘InputGraphs’ within the same directory as where the source code file is saved. This will allow the readinput() function to find the text files.

2. Create a folder called ‘OutputGraphs’ in that directory as well. This will allow the writeoutput() function to write the output files to that folder.

3. Run the entirety of the code in the source code file. This will cause 20 output files to be created in the ‘OutputGraphs’ folder.
